# sedlak-note-challenge

## Description

For this challenge, we had to connect front end and back end operations to create a running note taker and saver for small business purposes.

## Installation

I began by installing with npm, then went through the code. I had to do some debugging for the source code to function properly and save the notes as it was supposed to.  We had source code, so I simply bult out routes for the data to be displayed, saved and able to be seen again if the user wanted.

## Usage

To use the app, simply type in a note that you want to save.  Once you type it in, click the save icon in the top right to save the note.  Once the note is stored on the left hand side of the screen, feel free to click on it at any time and bring it back for editing.
